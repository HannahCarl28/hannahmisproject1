                            <h3>Swimming</h3>
                            <p>When I was in seventh grade, I decided to join my school district’s swim and dive team. From there I found a love for long distance swimming and became a long-distance swimmer for my team. This team made me find a love for a sport it also helped me find some of my lifetime friends. This sport has also taught me time management skills from having to be at practice at a certain time to having to make time to do schoolwork as well. Swimming is also where I learned to never give up and always do my best, because not every will be my best.</p>

                            <h3>Traveling</h3>
                            <p>From a very early age I loved traveling and getting to experience and try new things.  In my travels I have been to eleven different states and 3 different countries. Some of my favorite states I have been to include California, Florida, and New York. The countries I have traveled to are Costa Rica, Australia, and New Zealand. I was given the opportunity to travel to these places through my high school’s educational and cultural trips. Additionally, I was in Girl Scouts which allowed me to travel to some of these locations as well. All of these trips taught me about how everyone’s lives are different based on where they are from, which is why I find traveling important to me. </p>

                            <h3>Hunting</h3>
                            <p>In my life I have grown up in a deer hunting family. I personally started deer hunting when I turned ten and have gone hunting every year since. Every early morning, no matter what the weather was like, it is going to be out in my deer stand. I remember being 4, 5 and 6 sitting with my dad and waiting for a deer to walk or run by. I was also always trying to see a deer before my dad saw it, but most of the time he would see it first. The first year I was able to go was no different besides the part I could shoot my own deer, and that I did do. This hobby has always been important to me but also my whole family. It is a way we connect to each other and a conversation starter for my family.</p>

                    <h3>Fishing</h3>
                    <p>Along with hunting fishing is another hobby that is important not only to me, but also my family. Growing up whenever my family and I would go fishing, whether that is ice fishing, fishing in a boat or on the shore, we would always make a competition out of it. With some of the categories being the largest fish, smallest fish, the most, etc. Likewise, this hobby is share without my whole family with my aunt and uncle having an annual fish fry the second weekend in September. To me this hobby is relaxing and I great way to unwind from the stress of everyday life.</p>
