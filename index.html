                    <p>Hello! I'm Hannah Carlson. I graduated from Foley High School, Minnesota in May 2025, with my junior year and senior year being full Post- Secondary Enrollment Options. Currently, I’m a student at The University of Minnesota Duluth in which I am earning my Bachelors in Accounting degree and  planning on graduating Spring 2028. While I’m in college I am planning on having an internship that helps improve my accounting skills, and help prepare me to work in my future career. </p>

                        <h3>Swimming</h3>
                        <p>I have been swimming since I was 5 years old. I swam for my high school team all four years and was a team captain my senior year. I also swam for a club team outside of school for 8 years. I love swimming because it is a great way to stay active and it is also very relaxing.</p>
                        <h3>Traveling</h3>
                        <p>I have traveled to eleven different states and 3 different countries. Through my high school I was able to travel to Washington DC, New York City, and Costa Rica. Then through Girl Scouts I have been to California, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
