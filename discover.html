                <h1>Why I Chose Duluth</h1>
                <div class="content-text">
                    <p>When I was deciding if the University of Minnesota Duluth was my campus for further education, there were multiple influential reasons for my decision. The first was that a enjoyed the layout of the campus. In addition to the layout, I like the idea that everything is connected, and I would not have to walk outside in the winter to go to class. The next reason was the multitudes of study areas that are available to use. Additionally, I like the number of things to do and see surrounding the campus. For example, walking along Lake Superior on the Lakewalk to see the beautiful view of the lake. Then throughout the town there are different “lookout” points to see the entire city. Finally, I also love the multiple walking and hiking trials that are around the Duluth area. </p>
