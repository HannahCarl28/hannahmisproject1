                    <h3>Pitzl & Pitzl</h3>
                    <p>One of the companies that stuck out to me, and I would be interested in working with, is Pitzl & Pitzl. This company is an accounting and advising firm. This means that the company deals with examining issues that affect an individual or a business and then gives advice on ways to improve. Additionally, they come up with this advice using the latest technology. With this in mind their internship programs seem like they would be a good fit for me. This is because I’m working towards earning my bachelor’s in accounting, and I have past experience with using certain types of accounting systems. This experience would also allow me to interact with real people. </p>

                    <h3>Olson Thielen</h3>
                    <p>Olson Thielen is another company that had stuck out to me. This company is also an accounting firm that works with other companies. As they work with these companies, they figure out solutions for the company to grow and help with the success rate of the company. I believe their internship program would also be a good opportunity for me. In this case this company offers a “base camp”, which is a day for me to go and get familiar with the people who work there. Also allows me to get to know how the business operates. This would also give me an opportunity to use the skills I have learned and get real world experience. </p>
